## FizzBuzz K-Ary Tree
*Author: JP Jones*

---

### Problem Domain

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, determine whether or 
not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with 
the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

+ If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
+ If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
+ If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
+ If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
